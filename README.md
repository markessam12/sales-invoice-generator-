# sales-invoice-generator-
This project creates a "Sales Invoice Generator" using Java programming language. A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction. It provides the business with a record of the services theyâ€™ve provided to a client, when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business. Typically, a sales invoice will include a description of the service provided and the amount owed. Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.

The application was totally built using Java and it's user interface using Java Swing.
